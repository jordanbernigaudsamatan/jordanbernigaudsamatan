- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jordanbernigaudsamatan

I am a former French theoretical physics researcher who is now looking for a professional transition in the domain of data science and data analysis.
I am mostly interested in joining the project and work for companies/public agencies involved in environment, agriculture, health or social.
In this get-up you can find codes that were used in my former studies, including Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms used for particle physics.
I intend to develop machine learning and deep learning codes for my own training and for fun, as for instance a chess engine which is at a basic point now (implementation of deep learning will arrive within the next months).

If you wish to contact me, regarding projects or job offers please use the following email : jordanbernigaudsamatan@gmail.com

Best,
Jordan
