- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jordanbernigaudsamatan

I am a former french theoretical physics researcher and who is now looking for a profesional transition in the domain of data science and data analysis.
I am mostly interested in joining project and work for companies/public agencies involved in environement, agriculture, health or social.
In this github you can find some code that were used in some of my former studies, including markov chain monte carlo algorithm used for particle physics.
I intend develop some machine learning and deep learning codes for my own training and for fun, as for instance a chess engine.

If you wish to contact me, regarding projects or job offers please use the following email : jordanbernigaudsamatan@gmail.com

Best,
Jordan
